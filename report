I loaded my dataset and performed EDA on the dataset and noticed I had no missing vlaues in the dataset , and our dataset had 3 categorical features .
I dropped the customer name feature , and used LabelEncoder on the Gender and Location feature . I then did a little of univariate analysis and plotted it for visualisation . I also plotted the correlation matrix of columns and was able to find that none of the columns correlated with each other and had very less contributions to the Churn feature .
I then trained my base model for my base model I chose RandomForestClassifier , the accuracy that was given was very low .
I then optimised my model using RandomSearchCV to find the best hyperparamaters but even with the best parameters the accuracy didn't improve .
Then I decided to work with various classification models the models I chose were DecisionTree , LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier and BalancedBaggingClassifier .
The scores were not that great on any of the model.

I decided to work with neural networks then , first I trained a simple , three layered feed-forward neural network , I computed the accuracy and it still didn't improve .
Since Machine Learning is an iterative process , I decided to generate more features plotted some relations and trained my models again but I still didn't get satisfactory result .
I trained a multi-layered Neural Network again but with more layers and added dropout and dense layers with early stopping call backs , but my accuracy still didn't improve .

Then I decided to use AutoGluon a software that automatically trains various models , to confirm the results of my models , and yes the accuracy was the same even after using AutoGluon .

I reached a conclusion then that the data is not enough and the accuracy was kept aorund 50% . We need to add more features to the dataset . 
Examples : 
* Customer Activity: If you have data on customer activity or engagement (e.g., number of logins, click-through rates), consider adding these metrics as features.

* Customer Complaints/Issues: If available, include data on customer complaints or issues, such as the number of support tickets opened or the types of issues reported.

* Customer Satisfaction Scores: If we have customer satisfaction survey data, include satisfaction scores as features
